# Portfolio
Here is the code of my first ever portfolio, made using Hugo, HTML, CSS (native and Bulma) as well as a tiny bit of Javascript!

It has now been replaced by this portfolio : [https://github.com/JulesBobeuf/portfolio-ts](https://github.com/JulesBobeuf/portfolio-ts)

## How to run locally:

- Clone this repository
- Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
- Execute `hugo serv` in the folder.

## How to compile the web app?

cd into the right folder, and execute the command `hugo`.
It will compile the sources and generate the public folder.

You can then deploy it on your server!
