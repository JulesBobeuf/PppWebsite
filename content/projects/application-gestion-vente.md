### Context

Thomas Santoro, Aymeric Jakobowski, Pierre Shreiner and I had to develop a management / sales app that would be suitable for a company. We had just 2 weeks to do it, and there was a lot to be done : the program in itself, the adaptation into a GUI app, the unitary tests and much more. The technoclogies we had to use were Java and JavaFX.

### The Implementation

There was 4 different big parts to do : The article, client and stock parts first, then the lists to keep track of the cart of the buyer. I mainly worked on the last three parts with the help of Pierre Shreiner, one of my mates. The other two, Thomas Santoro and Aymeric Jakobowski, worked on the Client part as well as some management class assignements we had to do.

### Transformation into a GUI

At this point, we had a console app, but it was not very user friendly. We then logically had to transform it into a Graphic User Interface to improve that. There was multiple views that were all linked together. With the help of buttons and listboxs, we managed to display all the required data and to use all the features we programmed earlier.

### Unitary Tests

This is the part I was not involved in as I was focused on the GUI. Although, my mates spent multiple days on testing every single line of coded we developed prior the test part. This part of the Asignment was given to us later than the implementation. There was about 20 classes to test, which is why they had to spend a lot of time on it. They used JUnit in to write and execute the tests.


### How it works?

When you launch the application, you will find yourself in front of a GUI that will let you select which part your would like to access : clients, stocks... Afterwards, you will have menus that will open up, which will let you choose whether if you want to see the current data, if you want to add, update or delete data and so on. You could also select how you would want the data to be sorted. As a whole, the app is quite complete, especially for first year students.
