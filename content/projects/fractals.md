p1: "Beginning"
p1Text: "To begin with, we had to code the mathematic formulas in Java. It was not the hardest thing to do except the few design patterns we had to  use, just like an iterator for example. The biggest issue we bad was with Sierpinspki fractals as we needed to use Recursivity, but Aymeric made it out for us. On my side, I was coding the complex points and their representation in plans, as this is what we used to represent the fractals."
p2: "Creating the images"
p2Text: "To generate the fractals, we logically needed to create graphic representation for them. We made classes that would do this for us, using a few adaptors as well as a builder to do that. After launching the program, we would get an image saved at the root of this one, with the name we gave it."
p3: "Final Result"
p3Text: "We had two ways of creating the image : You could either use a test class which we had, or use bash programs made for each fractal. You could choose the colors the fractal would have, the zoom, the size of the image and so many parameters which made every new picture wonderful. It was a very hard project, with it's ups and down (me being sick and had fever for the whole week was one of those haha) but hey we made it, and that's what matters."
