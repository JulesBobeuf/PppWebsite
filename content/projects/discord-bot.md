context: "Context"
contextParagraph: "During my first year at university, I have learnt Python and PostgreSQL. While I was in holidays, I wanted to experience a bit and use what I had learnt at school on a real project"

p1: "Working environment"

p1Text: "In order to do this project, I had to familiarize myself with the psycopg2 library in Python as well as the different discord libraries for Python. The project was not long in itself but it took me a very long time to get each functionality working as there was a lot of bugs related to Python and the database"

p2: "Functionalities"

p2Text: "The bot's use was to add a currency to a server which you could earn by winning community events. Staff would give the currency to whichever user won the event with a private command. After earning a good amount, the users could purchase a role within the discord server."

p3: "Epilogue"

p3Text: "The bot was hosted on a cloud and later on my Raspberry PI in order to keep it online. I did not get to use it much, but it still was a great project to work on, as it taught me a lot of things related to coding, just like the use of async and await in Python, and most importantly how to use a database in a programming language."
